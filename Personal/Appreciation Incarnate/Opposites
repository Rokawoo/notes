Opposites
/ŏp′ə-zĭt/
Being the other of two complementary or mutually exclusive things.

Dichotomies, Booleans, Duality within thyself... I could go on but the idea is opposites are all around us, prevalent within our everyday lives.

Opposites in fact are a self validating system in which we draw the axioms of our reality:
- I am me, because I am not them, the boundary of self <= Man
- 0, and 1, the boundary of nothing <= Math
- Let there be light, and he separated the light from the darkness (Genesis 1:3-4), the boundary of creation <= World


Opposites comprise our very reality, inherent to its existence.
They are the basis that orientate the world.
