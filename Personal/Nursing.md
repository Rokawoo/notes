## ABG Interpretation

### Core Rule: Direction Analysis
The fundamental principle for determining metabolic vs respiratory disorders:

- **Same direction** (pH ↑ bicarb ↑ OR pH ↓ bicarb ↓) = **Metabolic**
- **Opposite directions** (pH ↑ bicarb ↓ OR pH ↓ bicarb ↑) = **Respiratory**

### Normal Values
- **pH**: 7.35-7.45
- **Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻)**: 22-26 mEq/L (remember "22 to 26")

### pH Classification
- **Acidosis**: pH < 7.35
- **Alkalosis**: pH > 7.45

### ABG Interpretation Decision Tree

```
START: Patient with ABG Results
│
├─ STEP 1: Check pH
│  ├─ pH < 7.35 → ACIDOSIS
│  ├─ pH > 7.45 → ALKALOSIS  
│  └─ pH 7.35-7.45 → NORMAL
│
├─ STEP 2: Determine Type (Direction Analysis)
│  ├─ Same Direction → METABOLIC
│  │  ├─ pH ↑ & HCO₃⁻ ↑ → Metabolic Alkalosis
│  │  └─ pH ↓ & HCO₃⁻ ↓ → Metabolic Acidosis
│  │
│  └─ Opposite Direction → RESPIRATORY
│     ├─ pH ↑ & HCO₃⁻ ↓ → Respiratory Alkalosis
│     └─ pH ↓ & HCO₃⁻ ↑ → Respiratory Acidosis
│
└─ STEP 3: Clinical Assessment
   ├─ ACIDOSIS (pH ↓)
   │  ├─ Neurological: Obtunded → Coma
   │  ├─ Cardiac: Bradycardia, Heart blocks
   │  ├─ Reflexes: +1 (Hypoactive)
   │  ├─ GI: Ileus, ↓ bowel sounds
   │  ├─ GU: Urinary retention
   │  └─ Electrolytes: Hyperkalemia (K⁺ ↑)
   │
   └─ ALKALOSIS (pH ↑)
      ├─ Neurological: Hyperexcitable → Seizures
      ├─ Cardiac: Tachycardia
      ├─ Reflexes: +3-4 (Hyperactive)
      ├─ GI: Hyperactive bowel sounds
      └─ Electrolytes: Hypokalemia (K⁺ ↓)
```

### Scenario-Based Quick Assessment

```
Clinical Scenario Assessment
│
├─ Is this a LUNG scenario?
│  │
│  ├─ YES → RESPIRATORY
│  │  │
│  │  ├─ Over-ventilating? → Respiratory Alkalosis
│  │  │  └─ (Hyperventilation, anxiety, mechanical over-ventilation)
│  │  │
│  │  └─ Under-ventilating? → Respiratory Acidosis
│  │     └─ (Hypoventilation, COPD, sedation, pneumonia)
│  │
│  └─ NO → METABOLIC
│     │
│     ├─ Prolonged vomiting/gastric suctioning?
│     │  └─ YES → Metabolic Alkalosis
│     │
│     └─ Other causes → Usually Metabolic Acidosis
│        └─ (Diarrhea, DKA, renal failure, sepsis)
```

### Key Pathophysiology

#### Respiratory Acidosis (Hypoventilation)
- **Mechanism**: Retained CO₂ → Increased carbonic acid
- **Cause**: Inadequate ventilation/gas exchange
- **Clinical Signs**: Ambu bag at bedside (indicates respiratory arrest risk)

#### Respiratory Alkalosis (Hyperventilation)
- **Mechanism**: Excessive CO₂ elimination → Decreased carbonic acid
- **Cause**: Over-ventilation
- **Clinical Signs**: Suction at bedside (indicates seizure risk)

#### Metabolic Alkalosis from Vomiting/Suctioning
- **Mechanism**: Loss of gastric acid → Relative alkalosis
- **Remember**: As water leaves the body, acid concentration appears higher

## Clinical Correlations

### The Golden Rule
> **"As the pH goes, so goes my patient"** (except for potassium, which goes opposite)

### Acidosis (pH ↓) - Everything Shuts Down

| System | Manifestation | Rationale |
|:-------|:-------------|:----------|
| **Neurological** | Obtunded → Coma | Depressed neural activity |
| **Cardiac** | Second-degree heart block | Slowed conduction |
| **Reflexes** | +1 (Hypoactive) | Decreased muscle responsiveness |
| **Gastrointestinal** | Adynamic ileus | No bowel movement |
| **Genitourinary** | Urinary retention | Bladder muscle dysfunction |
| **Electrolytes** | Hyperkalemia (K⁺ ↑) | K⁺ shifts out of cells |

### Alkalosis (pH ↑) - Everything Speeds Up

| System | Manifestation | Rationale |
|:-------|:-------------|:----------|
| **Neurological** | Hyperexcitability → Seizures | Increased neural activity |
| **Cardiac** | Tachycardia | Enhanced conduction |
| **Reflexes** | +3-4 (Hyperactive) | Increased muscle responsiveness |
| **Gastrointestinal** | Borborygmi (hyperactive sounds) | Increased motility |
| **Electrolytes** | Hypokalemia (K⁺ ↓) | K⁺ shifts into cells |

### Fundamental Testing Principle
> **In an acidotic environment, chemical reactions cease - everything shuts down**

This principle helps with select-all-that-apply questions by providing a framework for expected findings.

## Assessment Scales

### 0-4 Reflex Scale
- **0-1**: Hypoactive (associated with acidosis)
- **2**: Normal
- **3-4**: Hyperactive (associated with alkalosis)

## Ventilator Management

### High Pressure Alarm Management

```
HIGH PRESSURE ALARM
(Increased resistance to airflow)
│
├─ STEP 1: Check for Kinks
│  ├─ Kinked tubing found?
│  │  ├─ YES → Straighten tubing → Alarm resolved?
│  │  │                          ├─ YES → Continue monitoring
│  │  │                          └─ NO → Go to Step 2
│  │  └─ NO → Go to Step 2
│
├─ STEP 2: Empty Water from Tubing
│  ├─ Condensation in loops?
│  │  ├─ YES → Empty water → Alarm resolved?
│  │  │                     ├─ YES → Continue monitoring
│  │  │                     └─ NO → Go to Step 3
│  │  └─ NO → Go to Step 3
│
├─ STEP 3: Turn, Cough, Deep Breathe
│  ├─ Patient able to cooperate?
│  │  ├─ YES → Perform techniques → Alarm resolved?
│  │  │                           ├─ YES → Continue monitoring
│  │  │                           └─ NO → Go to Step 4
│  │  └─ NO → Go to Step 4
│
└─ STEP 4: Suction (ONLY if necessary)
   ├─ Evidence of secretions?
   │  ├─ YES → Suction airway → Alarm resolved?
   │  │                       ├─ YES → Continue monitoring
   │  │                       └─ NO → Call respiratory therapy/physician
   │  └─ NO → Call respiratory therapy/physician
```

### Low Pressure Alarm Management

```
LOW PRESSURE ALARM
(Decreased resistance - disconnections)
│
├─ STEP 1: Check Main Tubing Connections
│  ├─ Main tubing disconnected?
│  │  ├─ YES → Reconnect securely → Alarm resolved?
│  │  │                           ├─ YES → Continue monitoring
│  │  │                           └─ NO → Go to Step 2
│  │  └─ NO → Go to Step 2
│
├─ STEP 2: Check Oxygen Sensor Tubing
│  ├─ O₂ sensor tubing disconnected?
│  │  ├─ YES → Reconnect securely → Alarm resolved?
│  │  │                           ├─ YES → Continue monitoring
│  │  │                           └─ NO → Go to Step 3
│  │  └─ NO → Go to Step 3
│
├─ STEP 3: Check for Leaks
│  ├─ Audible air leaks?
│  │  ├─ YES → Identify source → Tighten connections
│  │  │                       └─ Call respiratory therapy if unable to fix
│  │  └─ NO → Go to Step 4
│
└─ STEP 4: System Check
   └─ All connections secure, no leaks found
      └─ Call respiratory therapy/physician for equipment evaluation
```

### Clinical Decision Making: Ventilator Weaning

#### Scenario Example
**Situation**: Doctor orders ventilator weaning for tomorrow AM, but 6 AM ABG shows respiratory acidosis

**Correct Action**: Hold order and call doctor

**Rationale**:
- Patient shows respiratory acidosis (under-ventilation)
- Cannot safely wean when patient is already under-ventilated
- **Desired finding**: Respiratory alkalosis before weaning (indicates over-ventilation and readiness)

### Key Ventilator Principles
- **Focus on gas exchange** (SaO₂), not just respiratory rate
- **Ventilation** refers to gas exchange, not breathing frequency
- **Suction only when necessary** - not a routine intervention

## Test-Taking Strategies

### Select All That Apply (SATA) Rules
- **Never** only one answer
- **Never** all answers
- Work systematically from ground up
- If uncertain about an option, **don't select it**
- Stop when you reach the logical number of answers
- **"It could be" is a killer phrase** - avoid overthinking

### Causation vs. Signs/Symptoms
Watch for questions that flip the relationship:

#### Common Mistake
- **Question asks**: What causes the acid-base disorder?
- **Student thinks**: What does the acid-base disorder cause?

#### Example
- **Diarrhea** → **Metabolic acidosis** (diarrhea is the **cause**)
- Don't confuse signs/symptoms with causation

### Nursing Scope Considerations
- **RN**: Can call doctor directly
- **LPN**: Must notify RN (who then calls doctor)
- **Avoid answers** where you delegate action without taking responsibility

## Key Vocabulary

### Medical Terminology
- **Borborygmi**: Increased bowel sounds (hyperactive GI)
- **Obtunded**: Severe lethargy (one step before coma)
- **Hyperemesis**: Excessive vomiting
- **Kussmaul respirations**: Deep, rapid breathing (compensatory mechanism)

### Acid-Base Associations
- **Ambu bag at bedside** → Suggests acidosis (respiratory arrest risk)
- **Suction at bedside** → Suggests alkalosis (seizure risk)

## Clinical Pearls

### Memory Aids

#### ABG Quick Reference
```
SAME direction = METABOLIC
OPPOSITE direction = RESPIRATORY

Normal Values:
pH: 7.35-7.45
HCO₃⁻: 22-26 mEq/L ("22 to 26")

"As the pH goes, so goes my patient"
(except K⁺ which goes opposite)
```

#### Ventilator Troubleshooting
```
HIGH Pressure = OBSTRUCTION
- Kinks in tubing
- Water in loops  
- Secretions in airway

LOW Pressure = DISCONNECTION  
- Main tubing disconnected
- O₂ sensor tubing disconnected
- System leaks
```

### Fundamental Learning Principles
> **"You can't apply what you don't know, but what you know you must be able to apply"**

> **"Use the tools at your disposal to get the answers - don't leave them in the box"**

### Critical Thinking Framework
1. **Assess the scenario** - Is it lung-related or not?
2. **Apply the rules** - Same/opposite direction analysis
3. **Consider physiology** - What makes sense based on pathophysiology?
4. **Choose systematically** - Don't overthink or second-guess solid knowledge

# Lecture 2: Substance Abuse & Aminoglycosides

## Table of Contents
1. [Therapeutic Communication](#therapeutic-communication)
2. [Substance Classification](#substance-classification)
3. [Overdose vs Withdrawal Framework](#overdose-vs-withdrawal-framework)
4. [Neonatal Withdrawal](#neonatal-withdrawal)
5. [Alcohol: AWS vs Delirium Tremens](#alcohol-aws-vs-delirium-tremens)
6. [Aminoglycosides](#aminoglycosides)

## Therapeutic Communication

**Rule**: Use "I" never "you" when confronting patient about behavior

**Codependency**: When codependent says no, dependent abuser will start demeaning their self-esteem

## Substance Classification

### The Rule
- **Every abused drug is an upper or a downer**

### Uppers (5 total)
- Caffeine
- Cocaine
- PCP/LSD (hallucinogens)  
- Methamphetamine
- **Adderall (ADD drug)**

### Downers (135 total)
- **Everything not an upper is a downer**

## Overdose vs Withdrawal Framework

### Step Process
1. **Upper or downer?**
2. **Overdose (too much) or withdrawal (too little)?**

### The Patterns
- **Upper overdose** = everything goes up
- **Downer overdose** = everything goes down
- **Upper withdrawal** = everything goes down  
- **Downer withdrawal** = everything goes up

### Key Insight
- **Upper overdose looks like downer withdrawal**
- **Downer overdose looks like upper withdrawal**

### Clinical Example
**Patient high on cocaine - what's critical to assess?**
- Cocaine = upper
- High = overdose = everything goes up
- **Don't** check respiratory rate (uppers don't cause respiratory arrest)
- **Do** check reflexes, heart rate

```
Assessment Framework
│
├─ Step 1: Upper or Downer?
│  └─ Check the lists above
│
├─ Step 2: Overdose or Withdrawal?  
│  └─ Too much drug vs too little drug
│
└─ Step 3: Apply Pattern
   ├─ Upper OD / Downer Withdrawal → Everything UP
   └─ Downer OD / Upper Withdrawal → Everything DOWN
```

## Neonatal Withdrawal

### Timeline Rules
- **Always assume intoxication at birth** (not withdrawal)
- **After 24 hours** = assume withdrawal

### Example: Quaalude-Addicted Mom
**24 hours after birth, select all that apply:**
- Difficult to console ✓
- Low core body temp ✗
- Exaggerated startle reflex ✓  
- Respiratory depression ✗
- Seizure risk ✓
- Shrill high-pitched cry ✓

**Logic**: Quaaludes not on upper list → downer → withdrawal after 24 hours → downer withdrawal = everything goes up

## Alcohol: AWS vs Delirium Tremens

### Key Facts
- **Every alcoholic** goes through alcohol withdrawal 24 hours after drinking
- **Only minority** get delirium tremens  
- **DT happens within 72 hours**
- **AWS always precedes DT, but DT doesn't always follow AWS**

### Critical Differences

| | AWS | DT |
|:--|:----|:---|
| **Life-threatening** | No | Yes (can kill) |
| **Dangerous to others** | No | Yes |
| **Patient state** | Loud/obnoxious | Dangerous/unstable |

### Care Differences

| Intervention | AWS | DT |
|:-------------|:----|:---|
| **Diet** | Regular | NPO/clear liquids |
| **Room** | Semi-private anywhere | Private near nurses station |
| **Activity** | Up ad lib | Restricted |
| **Restraints** | No | As needed |


## Aminoglycosides

### Memory Device
**"Treat a mean old infection with a mean old '-micin'"**

### Key Facts
- Used when **nothing else works** (dangerous)
- **All Aminoglycosides end in '-micin'** but not all '-micin' drugs are aminoglycosides
- **Route: IM or IV** (not absorbed PO)
- **Exception**: PO forms used to sterilize bowel before surgery

### The "8" Rule
Number 8 in ear reminds you:
1. **Toxic to cranial nerve 8**
2. **Give every 8 hours**

### Toxicity: Think "Mice → Ears → Kidney"
- **Mice** = micin
- **Ears** = ototoxicity → monitor hearing (tinnitus)  
- **Kidney** = nephrotoxicity → monitor creatinine

### Trough and Peak Levels
**Draw when**: Small difference between what works and kills

#### Trough Levels
- **When**: 30 minutes before next dose
- **Rule**: Always 30 minutes ( drug / route doesn't matter)

#### Peak Levels  
- **When**: Depends on route
- **Drug doesn't matter, route does**

### Oral Aminoglycosides
**Bowel sterilizers**: Neomycin and kanamycin
- **No ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity** (not absorbed)
- PO aminoglycoside = "expensive stool"

```
Trough/Peak Sequence (T.A.P.)
│
├─ Draw Trough (30 min before dose)
├─ Administer Drug  
└─ Draw Peak (time varies by route)
```

## Clinical Pearls

### Test Strategy
**Board assumptions**: All time in the world, all the staff in the world, staff don't mind assignment changes

### Substance Abuse Questions
1. Upper or downer?
2. Overdose or withdrawal?  
3. Pick the obvious answer

### Most Tested Drug Groups
1. Psych drugs
2. Insulins  
3. Anticoagulants
4. Digitalis
5. **Aminoglycosides**
