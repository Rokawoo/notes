## Introduction to Information Systems

### Importance of Information Systems in Business
- Provide competitive advantage through better information management
- Enable process automation and efficiency improvements
- Support decision-making with real-time data
- Connect organizational functions through integrated systems

## Computing Systems

### Mainframes
- Capable of adding or changing system capacity without shutting down the entire system
- Provide high reliability and processing power for business-critical applications
- Support thousands of users simultaneously

### Personal Computers
- Developed by IBM in the early 1980s and later popularized by companies like Apple, HP, and Dell
- Often networked together or added to networks to provide flexibility for managers
- Used for various business activities including:
- Email correspondence
- Document composition
- Online communications (Skype, WebEx)
- Database access and creation
- Spreadsheet use and creation
- Cloud access

### Transaction Processing Systems

#### Point of Sale (POS) Systems
- The cash register was the first modern transaction processing system
- Modern retail POS stations integrate multiple components:
- Cash register system
- Input devices (barcode scanners, scales, touchscreens)
- MICR check readers
- Credit/debit card readers
- Tactile numerical keyboards (for the blind)
- Cameras
- RFID tag readers

#### Mobile POS Evolution
- McDonald's was the first company to use a mobile POS
- Square (founded by Jack Dorsey) pioneered credit/debit card readers for mobile devices
- Provided affordable and flexible payment processing for small businesses
- Created a significant shift in payment accessibility

### Client-Server Architecture
- Client-server setup provides necessary services for business operations
- Clients (personal computers, mobile devices) request services from servers
- Servers provide processing power, data storage, and application hosting
- Accessed through networks of routers and network infrastructure

## Business Strategy and Competitive Advantage

### Porter's Five Forces
1. **Existing competitors** - Direct industry competition
2. **New competitors (threat)** - Potential market entrants
   - Strong barriers decrease this threat, while low barriers reduce profit margins
3. **Suppliers (bargaining power)** - Control over required resources
   - High demand allows suppliers to charge more as resources are necessary
4. **Customers (bargaining power)** - Influence over pricing and terms
   - A buyer representing a significant percentage of sales has substantial power over a firm
5. **Substitutes (threat)** - Alternative products/services that fulfill similar needs

### Competitive Advantage Concepts

#### Monopolistic Competition
- Creating a brand image that increases perceived value compared to competitors' products

#### Economies of Scale
- Using large production volumes or purchasing power to proportionally reduce marginal costs
- Allows organizations to pressure suppliers to lower prices due to buying volume

#### Elasticity of Demand
- Measures how quickly customer demand changes with price changes
- Highly elastic products see significant demand fluctuations with price changes

### Business Analysis Frameworks

#### SWOT Analysis
- Identifies an organization's:
- Internal Strengths
- Internal Weaknesses
- External Opportunities
- External Threats

#### Five Ps of Internal Scan
- **Personnel** (human resources)
- **Plant** (physical resources)
- **Processes** (activities that create value)
- **Purse** (financial strength)
- **Past experiences** (reputation and intangible assets)

#### PESTEL Analysis
Examines external factors affecting an organization:
- **Political** factors (tax policies, labor laws)
- **Economic** factors (market conditions, growth rates)
- **Socio-cultural** factors (demographics, social trends)
- **Technological** factors (innovations, R&D)
- **Environmental** factors (sustainability concerns)
- **Legal** factors (regulations, consumer protection)

### Business Strategies

#### Porter's General Business Strategies
Two fundamental approaches:
- **Price leadership** - Competing on cost efficiency
- **Product differentiation** - Competing on unique value
- Both can be applied in either niche or broad markets

#### Red Ocean vs. Blue Ocean Strategy
- **Red Ocean**: Competing in existing market space
- Fighting to make products better than competitors
- Represents intense, bloody competition

- **Blue Ocean**: Creating uncontested market space
- Developing new products for markets with little competition
- Avoids direct competitive pressure

#### First-Mover vs. Fast-Follower Strategy

**First-Mover Advantages:**
- Employee experience with new technologies and processes
- Opportunity to secure important raw materials
- Develop necessary logistics lines ahead of competitors
- Customer adaptation to product specifications

**Fast-Follower Strategy:**
- Learn from first-mover mistakes
- Improve upon existing products
- Example: Nigerian banks observed Western banks' offerings and then provided similar products

#### Disruptive Innovation
- Innovation that creates a new market and value network
- Often enters at the bottom of an existing market
- Eventually displaces established market leaders
- According to Christensen, success comes from using existing technologies in creative ways

## Business Processes

### Process Fundamentals
- Logically related set of tasks that define how a business operates
- A business is essentially a collection of processes
- Business processes can be assets (efficient, effective) or liabilities (inefficient, problematic)

### Order Fulfillment Process Example
Typical steps include:
1. Sales generates and submits order
2. Accounting checks credit and approves credit
3. Accounting generates invoice
4. Manufacturing/Production assembles product
5. Manufacturing/Production ships product

### Information Technology Impact on Processes
IT improves business processes by:
- Automating previously manual steps
- Changing information flows
- Converting sequential steps to parallel processing
- Eliminating delays in decision making
- Supporting new business models

### Threat Mitigation

Three main components:
1. **Prevention**: Proactive measures to block attacks
2. **Identification**: Detecting breaches when they occur
3. **Cure**: Remediation and recovery

### CIA Triad in Security
