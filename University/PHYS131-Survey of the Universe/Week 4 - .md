# Light and Spectra

Light is both a wave and a particle (photon)

## Spectra

**Spectrum**: A graph showing how much energy is emitted by an object at each wavelength of light

- **Prism** or **diffraction grating** can separate light into component wavelengths

## Blackbody Spectrum

**Thermal Blackbody**: An idealized object that absorbs and re-emits all electromagnetic radiation that hits it
- Emitted radiation depends only on the blackbody's temperature
- Example: Rod going from red → orange → white as temperature increases
- Allows determination of temperature of distant objects

## Blackbody Spectra

All matter above 0 K emits electromagnetic radiation

The distribution of emitted radiation (spectrum shape) depends **only** on temperature:
- Blackbody curve increases for hotter objects
- Peaks of different temperature stars fall in different parts of electromagnetic spectrum
- Hotter stars emit more frequencies of light


Spectra can tell us the surface temperature of our object.
- The wavelength of the peak of an blackbody spectrum only depends on the blackbody's temperature (Wien's Law)

## Blackbody Curves

As temperature increases:
- More frequencies of light are emitted
- More energy is emitted (curve's peak increases)
- Peak wavelength shifts to shorter wavelengths (bluer)

## Spectroscopy
**Spectroscopy**: analyzing electromagnetic spectra to lean about distant atoms and molecules

**Dispersion**: different wavelength light bends at different angles

## The Atom
Electrons can only orbit a nucleus at a specific distances. THese states are called energy levels and are unique to each element.
- Nucleus & Proton Core
- Electron Energy Level 1
- ...
- Electron Energy Level 7

## Electron Transitions
When an electron shifts between these energy levels, energy is absorbed or emitted as light. The wavelength of this light corresponds to the energy difference between the two energy levels.

- Each element can only absorb and emit light that is specific to it.
