# Survey of the Universe - Lecture Notes

## What is Astronomy?
**Astronomy**: The study of the universe  
**Universe**: All space, time, matter, and energy

## Key Concepts

### Light and Distance
- **Speed of light**: c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s (186,000 miles/s)
- Light takes time to travel → we see distant objects as they appeared in the past
- **Light year**: Distance light travels in 1 year = 9.46 × 10¹² km

### Distance Units
- **Astronomical Unit (AU)**: Average Sun-Earth distance = 1.496 × 10¹¹ m
- Used for measuring distances within our solar system

### Scientific Notation
Express very large/small numbers as: **a × 10ⁿ** (where 1 ≤ a < 10)
- Large numbers: positive exponent (745,300 = 7.453 × 10⁵)
- Small numbers: negative exponent (0.000675 = 6.75 × 10⁻⁴)

## The Night Sky

### Constellations
- **88 official constellations** form a "political map" of Earth's night sky
- Not groups of physically close stars, but patterns as seen from Earth
- **Asterism**: Pattern of stars in the night sky (e.g., Big Dipper)

### Celestial Sphere
- Imaginary sphere surrounding Earth where stars appear to be located
- **Not real** - just a convenient visualization tool
- Stars that appear close may be vastly different distances from Earth
- Projects Earth's coordinate system (longitude/latitude) into space

### Important Features
- **Horizon**: Where sky meets Earth from observer's viewpoint
- **Ecliptic**: Path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over a year
  - Tilted 23.5° from celestial equator
  - Plane in which planets orbit the Sun

## How We Study the Universe
Since we can't travel to distant objects, astronomers study their **emitted light** (plus neutrinos and gravitational waves) to learn about them.
