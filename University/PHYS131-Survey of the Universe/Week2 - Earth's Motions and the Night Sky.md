# Earth's Motions and the Night Sky

## Why Stars Move Across the Sky

Stars appear to move because **Earth rotates on its axis** (not because stars are actually moving)

- Stars are too far away to see their actual motion relative to each other
- Different apparent motion patterns depend on observer's location on Earth

## The Celestial Sphere

- **Imaginary sphere** surrounding Earth where stars appear fixed
- Projects Earth's latitude/longitude system onto the sky
- Helps visualize star positions since we lack depth perception for distant objects

## Key Sky References

### Locations

- **Horizon**: Boundary between Earth and sky (objects below are not visible)
- **Zenith**: Point directly overhead
- **Meridian**: Imaginary line from due South to due North through zenith
- **Ecliptic**: Path Sun traces on celestial sphere over a year (tilted 23.5° from celestial equator)

### Star Motion by Location

- **North/South Poles**: Stars move horizontally, parallel to horizon
- **Equator**: Stars rise/set vertically when looking East/West
- **Mid-latitudes**: Stars move in diagonal arcs across sky

## Circumpolar Stars

- Stars that **never set below the horizon** from a given location
- Northern Hemisphere: Circle around Polaris (North Star)
- Polaris nearly stationary (~0.75° from North Celestial Pole)

## Earth's Three Motions

### 1. Rotation (Daily)

- Causes day/night cycle
- Makes stars appear to move across sky

### 2. Revolution (Yearly)

- Orbit around Sun
- Different stars visible at different times of year
- Creates the **zodiac**: 12-13 constellations Sun passes through

### 3. Precession (26,000 years)

- Slow wobble of Earth's rotational axis
- Changes which star is the "North Star" over millennia
- Shifts zodiac signs over time

## The Zodiac

- Your astrological "sign" = constellation behind Sun on your birthday
- Actually 13 constellations (includes Ophiuchus)
- Signs have shifted due to precession since ancient times
