# Seasons, Moon Phases, and Eclipses

## The Seasons

### Why Seasons Occur

Earth's **23.5° axial tilt** creates seasons by changing how directly sunlight hits each hemisphere:

- **Summer**: Hemisphere tilted toward Sun → sunlight hits more directly → more energy per area
- **Winter**: Hemisphere tilted away → sunlight spreads over larger area → less energy per area
- When Northern Hemisphere has summer, Southern has winter (and vice versa)

### Key Events (Northern Hemisphere)

- **Summer Solstice**: North Pole tilted maximally toward Sun → Sun highest in sky
- **Winter Solstice**: North Pole tilted maximally away from Sun → Sun lowest in sky
- **Equinoxes**: Earth's axis perpendicular to Sun → equal day/night hours

### Seasonal Changes

- **Summer**: Sun higher in sky → concentrated energy → warmer + longer daylight hours
- **Winter**: Sun lower in sky → spread-out energy → cooler + shorter daylight hours

### Precession

- Earth's rotational axis wobbles in a 26,000-year cycle
- Seasons swap every 13,000 years (winter becomes summer)

## Moon Phases

### Key Concept

The Sun always illuminates 50% of the Moon; phases show how much of that lit side we see from Earth

### Phase Cycle (29.5 days)

| Phase         | Illuminated | Rises    | Sets     |
| :------------ | :---------- | :------- | :------- |
| New Moon      | 0%          | 6am      | 6pm      |
| First Quarter | 50% (right) | Noon     | Midnight |
| Full Moon     | 100%        | 6pm      | 6am      |
| Third Quarter | 50% (left)  | Midnight | Noon     |

**Waxing** = growing brighter (right side lit)  
**Waning** = growing dimmer (left side lit)

## Eclipses

### Shadow Zones

- **Umbra**: Complete shadow (all light blocked)
- **Penumbra**: Partial shadow (some light blocked)

### Lunar Eclipse

Earth blocks sunlight from reaching Moon

- **Total**: Entire Moon in Earth's umbra
- **Partial**: Part of Moon in umbra
- **Penumbral**: Moon only in penumbra
- Duration: Up to 1 hour 47 minutes

### Solar Eclipse

Moon blocks sunlight from reaching Earth

- **Total**: Sun completely covered
- **Partial**: Sun partially covered
- **Annular**: Ring of Sun visible around Moon
- Duration: Maximum 7.5 minutes

### Eclipse Frequency

- Don't occur monthly because Moon's orbit tilted 5° from ecliptic
- **Annual occurrence**: 2-5 solar, 2-5 lunar (maximum 7 combined)
- Eclipses only possible when Moon crosses ecliptic plane
