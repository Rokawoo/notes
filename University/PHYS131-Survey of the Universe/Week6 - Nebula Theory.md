# Solar System Formation

## Definition and Structure

A solar system consists of a star and all the objects that orbit it. Our solar system contains:
- One star (the Sun)
- Eight planets
- 421 moons (or 891 depending on classification)
- Many dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids

## Characteristics of Our Solar System

### Orbital and Structural Patterns

Our solar system exhibits ten key characteristics that reveal how it formed:

1. Each planet is relatively isolated in its own orbital region
2. The planets' orbits are nearly circular
3. The planets' orbits are basically in the same plane
4. The planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction (counterclockwise from North Celestial Pole)
5. Most planets rotate on their axis in the same sense as the Sun (counterclockwise from North Celestial Pole)
6. Two different types of planets exist: terrestrial and Jovian
7. Most of the planets' moons revolve in the same direction as the parent planet's orbit around the Sun
8. Asteroids are very old and are different from the planets and their moons
9. Kuiper belt objects are icy asteroids orbiting the Sun further than Neptune
10. Oort cloud comets are icy bodies with highly elliptical and tilted orbits

## Interstellar Medium

The interstellar medium is the material found between stars. Its composition reflects cosmic history:

| Element | Percentage |
|:--------|:-----------|
| Hydrogen | 78% |
| Helium | 20% |
| Heavier Elements | 2% |

Hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of lithium and beryllium were created at the beginning of the universe during the Big Bang. All heavier elements were created and dispersed by stars through nuclear fusion and stellar death.

## Nebular Theory

The nebular theory explains how a new star and solar system form when interstellar medium condenses into a single, rotating cloud of gas and dust that ultimately collapses. This cloud is called a solar nebula.

The nebular theory directly explains several solar system characteristics:
- Characteristic 4: All planets orbit in the same direction due to the rotation of the original nebula
- Characteristic 5: Most planets rotate in the same sense because of the nebula's angular momentum
- Characteristic 7: Moons orbit in the same direction due to the inherited rotation from the nebula

## Protostar Formation

The formation sequence follows these steps:

1. A solar nebula begins a few light-years across
2. A disturbance triggers the nebula to start contracting
3. Gravity continues the contraction
4. The central region becomes dense and hot, forming a protostar

The protostar heats through the Conservation of Energy: as material falls inward, gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy, which then becomes thermal energy through collisions.

## Gravity

Every mass in the universe exerts an attractive force on every other mass:

```haskell
F_gravity = G * (M₁ * M₂) / r²
```

Two key principles govern gravitational attraction:
- Bigger masses exert stronger gravitational forces
- Smaller separations between masses produce stronger gravitational forces

## Energy

Energy is the ability of an object to change its state. These states include an object's:
- Location relative to another object (with mass or electric charge)
- Speed
- Luminosity
- Temperature
- Chemical composition
- Phase of matter

### Law of Conservation of Energy

Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another.

This law explains how the collapsing solar nebula heats up: gravitational energy converts to kinetic energy, which converts to thermal energy.

## Angular Momentum

Angular momentum describes the tendency for something to keep spinning:

```haskell
Angular Momentum = m * v * r
```

### Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum

Angular momentum must remain the same unless an outside spinning force acts on the object.

Consider an ice skater spinning with hands extended. When the skater pulls their hands to their chest, the radius decreases. To conserve angular momentum, the rotational velocity must increase—the skater spins faster.

The same physics applies to the collapsing solar nebula.

## Protoplanetary Disk Formation

As the solar nebula contracts, several changes occur:
- It spins faster (conservation of angular momentum)
- It flattens out into a protoplanetary disk
- Orbits become more circular
- Ultimately, the protostar gets hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium (a star is born)

This disk formation explains additional solar system characteristics:
- Characteristic 2: The planets' orbits are nearly circular
- Characteristic 3: The planets' orbits are basically in the same plane

## Observational Evidence

The Hubble Space Telescope has imaged at least 42 protoplanetary disks (baby solar systems) in the Orion Nebula. The Atacama Large Millimeter Array has captured detailed images of systems like HL Tau, showing the disk structure where planets form.

## Condensation Theory

Dust in the solar nebula plays a critical role:
- Radiates heat away from the disk as infrared radiation
- Allows matter in the disk to collapse by cooling
- Acts as condensation nuclei (seeds) around which other matter can collect

## Accretion

Accretion is the growth of an object as outside material sticks to it.

The planet formation process:
1. After significant accretion, condensation nuclei have formed into planetesimals
2. Planetesimals collide with each other
3. They accrete stray gas and dust
4. They eventually form planets

This process explains Characteristic 1: Each planet is relatively isolated because it cleared its orbital neighborhood during formation.

## Formation Summary

The complete sequence of solar system formation:

**Solar Nebula** → **Protostar** → **Protoplanetary Disk** → **Planetesimals** → **Planets**

Each stage follows from fundamental physics: gravity drives collapse, energy conservation produces heating, and angular momentum conservation creates rotation and flattening. The observable characteristics of our solar system directly reflect this formation history.
