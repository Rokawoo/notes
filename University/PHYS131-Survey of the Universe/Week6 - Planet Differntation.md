# Solar System Formation (Continued)

## Review: Solar System Definition

A solar system consists of a star and all the objects that orbit it. Our solar system contains:
- One star (the Sun)
- Eight planets
- 421 moons (or 891 depending on classification)
- Many dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids

## Review: Solar System Characteristics

Our solar system exhibits ten key patterns:

1. Each planet is relatively isolated
2. The planets' orbits are nearly circular
3. The planets' orbits are basically in the same plane
4. The planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction (counterclockwise from North Celestial Pole)
5. Most planets rotate on their axis in the same sense as the Sun (counterclockwise from North Celestial Pole)
6. Different types of planets exist (terrestrial vs Jovian)
7. Most of the planets' moons revolve in the same direction as the parent planet's orbit around the Sun
8. Asteroids are very old and are different from the planets and their moons
9. Kuiper belt objects are icy asteroids orbiting the Sun further than Neptune
10. Oort cloud comets are icy bodies with highly elliptical and tilted orbits

## Review: Formation Sequence

The nebular theory describes solar system formation through these stages:

**Solar Nebula** → **Protostar** → **Protoplanetary Disk** → **Planetesimals** → **Planets**

### Solar Nebula to Protostar

1. Solar nebula begins a few light-years across
2. A disturbance triggers the nebula to start contracting
3. Gravity continues the contraction
4. The central region becomes dense and hot, forming a protostar through the Conservation of Energy

### Protoplanetary Disk Formation

As the solar nebula contracts:
- It spins faster (conservation of angular momentum)
- It flattens out into a protoplanetary disk
- Orbits become more circular
- Ultimately, the protostar gets hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium (a star is born)

This explains:
- Characteristic 2: The planets' orbits are nearly circular
- Characteristic 3: The planets' orbits are basically in the same plane

### Condensation Theory

Dust in the solar nebula plays critical roles:
- Radiates heat away from the disk as infrared radiation
- Allows matter in the disk to collapse by cooling
- Acts as condensation nuclei (seeds) around which other matter can collect

### Accretion

Accretion is the growth of an object as outside material sticks to it.

The process:
1. After significant accretion, condensation nuclei form into planetesimals
2. Planetesimals collide with each other
3. They accrete stray gas and dust
4. Eventually form planets

This explains Characteristic 1: Each planet is relatively isolated because it cleared its orbital neighborhood.

## Planet Differentiation

The solar system contains two fundamentally different planet types:

**Inner 4 planets (terrestrial)**: Small and rocky

**Next 4 planets (Jovian)**: Gas giants

### Temperature Gradient

The temperature gradient within the solar nebula means that different compounds exist as solids at different locations. Temperature decreases with distance from the forming Sun.

### Frost Line (Snow Line)

The frost line marks a critical boundary in the protoplanetary disk. Past this line, water vapor can exist as solid ice. Inside this line, water remains gaseous.

### Material Distribution

The frost line creates two distinct zones:

**Inside the Frost Line:**
- Rocks and metals exist as solids
- Water remains gaseous
- Less solid material available

**Beyond the Frost Line:**
- Rocks, metals, and ices all exist as solids
- Water freezes into ice
- More solid material available to stick together
- More material enables formation of larger planetesimals

### Formation of Gas Giants

Beyond the frost line, conditions favored formation of massive planets:

1. Lower temperatures allowed ices to condense
2. More solid material created larger protoplanets
3. Larger protoplanets had stronger gravity
4. Stronger gravity swept up more hydrogen and helium gas
5. This created a positive feedback loop: more mass → stronger gravity → more gas captured → even more mass

This explains Characteristic 6: Different types of planets exist (terrestrial vs Jovian)

The terrestrial planets formed in the hot inner region where only rocks and metals condensed. The Jovian planets formed in the cold outer region where abundant ices allowed much larger cores to develop, which then captured massive atmospheres of hydrogen and helium.

## Solar System Timeline

The formation of our solar system followed this sequence:

| Time from Start | Event |
|:----------------|:------|
| 4.6 billion years ago | Protostar forms |
| 10 million years | Jovian planets form |
| 50 million years | Protostar officially becomes a star (begins nuclear fusion) |
| 100 million years | Terrestrial planets form |

Note that the Jovian planets formed faster than terrestrial planets. The abundance of solid material beyond the frost line allowed rapid accretion of large bodies. The terrestrial planets took longer to assemble from the limited rocky material in the inner solar system.

## Small Body Populations

### Asteroids

Asteroids are very old objects that differ fundamentally from planets and their moons. These rocky bodies preserve material from the early solar system that never assembled into planets. Most asteroids orbit in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

This explains Characteristic 8: Asteroids represent leftover planetesimals from solar system formation.

### Kuiper Belt

The Kuiper belt contains icy objects orbiting the Sun beyond Neptune's orbit. These objects can be thought of as frozen asteroids composed of ices, rocks, and organic compounds.

This explains Characteristic 9: Kuiper belt objects are icy asteroids in the outer solar system.

### Oort Cloud

The Oort cloud is a spherical shell of icy bodies surrounding the solar system at extreme distances. Unlike the planets and Kuiper belt objects that orbit in a flat disk, Oort cloud comets have highly elliptical and tilted orbits in all directions.

This explains Characteristic 10: Oort cloud comets have very different orbital characteristics than planets.

## Summary

Planet differentiation results from the temperature gradient in the protoplanetary disk. The frost line separated the disk into two zones: a hot inner region where only rocks and metals condensed to form small terrestrial planets, and a cold outer region where abundant ices enabled formation of massive cores that captured hydrogen and helium to become gas giants.

The timeline shows Jovian planets formed quickly (10 million years) due to abundant material, while terrestrial planets required longer (100 million years) to assemble from limited rocky material. Leftover planetesimals remain as asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, and Oort cloud comets—preserving evidence of the early solar system.
