# Small Solar System Bodies

## Review: Solar System Characteristics

**8.** Asteroids are very old and are different from the planets and their moons

**9.** Kuiper belt are icy asteroids orbiting the Sun further than Neptune

**10.** Oort cloud comets are icy bodies with highly elliptical and tilted orbits

## Asteroids

Chunks of rock and metal left over from the formation of the solar system (leftover inner solar system planetesimals)

### Formation Location

- Inside the frost line: rocks and metals exist as solids
- Beyond the frost line: rocks, metals, and ices exist as solids
- Asteroids formed where only rocks and metals could condense

### Size Distribution

- Most asteroids are very small (< 1 km)
- Four are larger than 300 km: Ceres, Pallas, Juno, Vesta

### The Asteroid Belt

- Most asteroids exist in the asteroid belt
- Located between Mars and Jupiter (2 to 3.5 AU from the Sun)
- Most likely a "failed" planet
- Jupiter's gravity prevented a planet from forming
- If the asteroid belt had formed a planet, it would only be ½ the size of the Moon

### Trojan Asteroids

- Orbit in front of and behind Jupiter
- Caused by a gravitational balance between Jupiter and the Sun
- More than 15,000 are known

## Meteoroids and Related Objects

### Meteoroids

Small asteroids (< 100 m across)
- Most are less than 1 millimeter

### Terminology

**Asteroid**: A big rocky object orbiting the Sun (>100m across)

**Meteoroid**: A small rocky object orbiting the Sun (<100m across)

**Meteor**: The streak seen in the sky caused by a meteoroid burning up in Earth's atmosphere

**Fireball**: A very bright meteor

**Bolide**: A meteor that explodes in the atmosphere

**Meteorite**: Any piece of a meteoroid or asteroid that makes it through Earth's atmosphere and hits the Earth

### Notable Events

**Chelyabinsk (February 2013)**: Major bolide event demonstrating impact potential

## Comets

Dirty balls of ices (methane, ammonia, CO₂, & H₂O) left over from the formation of the solar system (leftover outer solar system planetesimals)

### Formation Location

- Beyond the frost line: rocks, metals, and ices exist as solids
- More solid material available beyond frost line
- Ices could condense in cold outer regions

### Comet Structure (Parts of Comet)

**Nucleus**: About 10 km in diameter (solid ice and rock core)

**Coma**: Halo of vaporized gases and dust from nucleus

**Ion/Plasma Tail**: 
- Made up of very light charged particles
- Points directly away from the Sun
- Tells nothing about motion, only position relative to Sun

**Dust Tail**:
- Made up of heavier dust particles
- Points partly towards the direction the comet is coming from (but still away from the Sun)
- Heavier particles lag behind

### Recent Comets

- NEOWISE (July 2020)
- Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS (October 2024)

### Rosetta Mission

- Orbited Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko
- Lander (Philae) deployed November 2014
- Mission ended September 2016
- Provided detailed information about comet composition

## Comet Origins

### Kuiper Belt

- Flattened disk of leftover icy planetesimals out past Neptune
- Distance: 30-50 AU from Sun
- These comets were formed here
- Disk-shaped, in same plane as planets

### Oort Cloud

- Theorized spherical distribution of leftover icy planetesimals
- Much further from Sun than Kuiper Belt
- Distance: 2,000-50,000 AU from Sun
- These comets were formed between Jupiter and Neptune
- Flung to current location by gravitational interactions with baby Jovian planets
- Spherical shell surrounding solar system

### Key Difference

| Kuiper Belt | Oort Cloud |
|:------------|:-----------|
| Formed where they are | Formed closer, ejected outward |
| Disk-shaped | Spherical shell |
| 30-50 AU | 2,000-50,000 AU |

## Meteor Showers

- Occur when Earth orbits into leftover comet debris
- Happen at the same time each year (Earth's orbit is consistent)
- Named after the constellation they appear to originate from (radiant point)
- Debris trails remain relatively stationary in space

## Pluto and Planet Classification

### Pluto's Characteristics

- Noticeably elliptical and highly tilted orbit around the Sun
- Only 2x as big as its moon (Charon)
- Located ~40 AU from Sun
- Classified a planet from discovery until 2006

### The Pluto Problem

If Pluto is a planet, why not Eris? Discovery of similar-sized objects required formal planet definition.

### Planet Requirements

A solar system object is considered a planet if it:

1. **Orbits the Sun**
2. **Is massive enough to be spherical** (hydrostatic equilibrium)
3. **Has cleared the path of its orbit** (gravitationally dominant in neighborhood)

### Dwarf Planets

- Meet first two planet criteria
- Have NOT cleared their orbital neighborhood
- Pluto shares orbital region with many Kuiper Belt objects
- Other dwarf planets: Eris, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea

### Old vs New Solar System

**Old**: Nine planets (included Pluto)

**New**: Eight planets + dwarf planets category
