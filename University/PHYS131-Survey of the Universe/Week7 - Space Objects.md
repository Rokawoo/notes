# Space Objects

## Asteroid

A big rocky object orbiting the sun (>100 m), wasn't ecrited by any of our major planets

## Meteoroid

a small rocky object orbiting the sun

## Meteor

the streak seen in the sky that is caused by a meteoroid bruning up in the Erth's atmosphere

## Fireball

A very bright meteor

## Bolide

A meteor that explodes in the atmosphere

## Meteorite

Any piece of rock or metal from space that survives its passage through Earth’s atmosphere and lands on the surface of the Earth.

# Comets

Dirty balls of ices (methane, ammonia, CO_2, & H_2O) left over from the formation of the solar system (leftover outer-solar system planetesimals)

## Parts of a Comet

- Nucleus: Solid Ice / Rock Core
- Coma: Halo of vaporized gasses and dust from nucleus, reflected light from sun
- Ion / Plasma tail: Made up of very light charged particles and **points directly away from the Sun**. Tells of nothing of the motion, but relative location to Sun.
- Dust tail: Made up of heavier dust particles, so it points partly towards the direction that the comet is coming from (but still away from the Sun).

# Meteor Showers

Meteor showers occur when the Earth orbits into leftover comet debris.
These happen the same time each year, because leftover comet debris is relatively stationary.

# Pluto

Notably elliptical and highly tilted orbit around teh Sun
Only 2x as big as it's moon (Charon)
Classified a planet from its discovery until 2006
