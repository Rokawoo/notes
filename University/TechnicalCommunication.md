## Core Principles

### Importance of Technical Communication
- The better you can communicate, the more valuable you are to your employer
- Strive for excellence, not perfection (Don't let the perfect ruin the good)

### What Makes a Good Technical Document
- Addresses the audience appropriately
- Helps readers solve problems
- Maintains consistent branding
- Results from collaborative effort
- Demonstrates brevity
- Employs good design
- Effectively combines words and images

### 9 Parts of Excellence
1. **Honesty**
2. **Clarity** - Accessible to all reader levels
3. **Accuracy**
4. **Comprehensiveness**
5. **Accessibility**
6. **Conciseness** - Eliminate fluff, be economical
7. **Professional Appearance**
8. **Correctness**
9. **Usability**

### Contextual Factors to Consider
- **Audience Factors**
- **Purpose Factors**
- **Setting Factors** - Formal vs. Informal
- **Document Factors** - Collaboration opportunities, deadlines, information availability vs. document length
- **Process Factors** - Established processes, formatting, templates, budget, etc.

## The Writing Process

### Planning
- Generate ideas
- Analyze audience and purpose
- Research thoroughly
- Organize content for readers
- Select appropriate application, design, and delivery method
- Ask: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How?

### Revising
**Key Questions:**
- Has your understanding of the audience changed?
- Has your understanding of your purpose changed?
- Has your understanding of the subject changed?

**Quality Checks:**
- Is it accurate?
- Have I followed the organizational format?
- Have I provided enough concrete evidence?
- Does the tone suit the audience?

### Proofreading & Editing
- Introduces a new perspective (fresh pair of eyes)
- Focuses on three critical parts of excellence: Honesty, Clarity, and Accuracy
- **Editing** is a macro function (big picture) dealing with content and structure
- **Proofreading** is a micro function (little picture) focused on handling mistakes
- Can't rely solely on spell checkers (e.g., Segway vs. Segue)
- Be aware of stylistic conventions like oxford commas

### Collaboration

   - Bees: Under 1 hour training, continuous operation through rotation

3. **Economic Viability**
   - Dogs: ¬£70,000/$89,000 first year, ¬£50,000/$63,000 subsequent years
   - Bees: Minimal training costs, rapid scaling (500 bees trained in 5 hours)

4. **Practical Considerations**
   - Dogs: Established reputation, versatility
   - Bees: Fewer ethical concerns, compact deployable systems
